I am a PhD student at the School of Environmental Science, Nanjing University. From September 2022 to September 2023, I studied in the Department of Economics at the University of Sussex Business School. Since then, I began focusing my research on the economic impacts of climate change. My current research focuses on climate change impact assessment and integrated assessment modeling. For the former, I am interested in the macroeconomic impacts of climate change and its spatial spillover effects. For the latter, I have developed a Climate Loss Assessment Integrated Multi-model System (CLAIM model) that couples the FUND model, FaIR model, and MESMER model for subnational and gridded-level social cost of carbon estimation. I am also interested in China's decarbonization pathways analysis through the MESSAGEix model, as well as China's environmental policy evaluation.
