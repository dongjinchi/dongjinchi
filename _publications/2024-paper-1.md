The majority of estimates of the social cost of carbon use preference parameters calibrated to data for North America and Europe. We here use statistically representative data for attitudes to time and risk across the world. The social cost of carbon is substantially higher in the global north than in the south. The difference is more pronounced if we count people rather than countries.
